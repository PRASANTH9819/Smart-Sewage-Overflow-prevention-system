# Smart Sewage Overflow Prevention System

## Overview
The **Smart Sewage Overflow Prevention System** is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor sewage water levels and prevent overflow situations. The system utilizes ultrasonic sensors to measure water levels and a GSM module to send alerts via SMS and calls when predefined thresholds are crossed. This ensures timely action to prevent potential hazards and damages caused by sewage overflow.

## Features
- **Real-time water level monitoring** using an ultrasonic sensor.
- **Automated alerts** via SMS and calls using a GSM module (SIM900A).
- **Threshold-based notifications**:
  - Water detected less than 3 feet from the top → Emergency alert via call and SMS.
  - Water detected less than 5 feet from the top → Warning alert via SMS.
  - Water detected less than 7 feet from the top → Precautionary alert via SMS.
- **Manual control options** via serial communication:
  - `s` : Send SMS
  - `c` : Make a call
  - `h` : Disconnect a call
  - `i` : Receive a call
  - `e` : Redial

## Components Used
- **Microcontroller** (ESP32/Arduino with UART capability)
- **Ultrasonic sensor** for distance measurement
- **GSM module (SIM900A)** for SMS and call alerts
- **Jumper wires & power supply**

## Circuit Diagram
(Include a schematic diagram or Fritzing diagram here if possible)

## Installation & Setup
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the microcontroller.
   - Interface the GSM module with the microcontroller (TX/RX connections).
   - Provide appropriate power supply connections.

2. **Software Setup:**
   - Install the Arduino IDE and required libraries (if using an Arduino-based board).
   - Upload the provided `smart_sewage_prevention.ino` code to the microcontroller.
   - Modify the phone number in the code to receive alerts.

## Code Explanation
- The microcontroller reads the ultrasonic sensor values continuously.
- When the water level reaches a critical point, it triggers the GSM module to send alerts.
- The system also allows manual SMS and call operations via serial commands.

## Usage
- Deploy the system in areas prone to sewage overflow.
- Monitor alerts and take action based on the received notifications.

## Future Improvements
- Integration with IoT cloud platforms for remote monitoring.
- Use of AI/ML to predict overflow patterns.
- Battery backup for uninterrupted operation.
